A large share of the documents in an academic environment have an origin in a format that is proprietary.  These tools are designed to extract files from a GridFS (mongodb filestore) and convert these files first to PDF then to either text or an image based format. After conversion then store these files back in a GridFS filesystem an easy to reference name structure for use by other applications.

To get the best possible visual accurate conversion we rely on COM objects for the conversion process.  The program currently runs in a Windows environment and requires Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat Professional and the 32 bit version of Python.
